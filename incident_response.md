# Git Crisis Management - Incident Response Plan

## üö® **Emergency Scenario**
**"API keys were accidentally committed to your public repository 3 commits ago. The keys are currently active in production."**

---

## ‚ö° **IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (First 15 Minutes)**

### **Phase 1: Damage Control - URGENT**

#### **Step 1: Rotate Compromised Credentials (Priority #1)**
```bash
# IMMEDIATE ACTION - Before any git cleanup
# 1. Log into your API provider dashboard
# 2. Immediately revoke/deactivate the exposed keys
# 3. Generate new API keys
# 4. Update production systems with new keys
# 5. Verify production systems are functioning with new keys
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Never attempt git history cleanup before rotating credentials. Exposed keys must be considered compromised permanently.

#### **Step 2: Assess the Exposure**
```bash
# Check commit history to identify the exposure
git log --oneline -10
git show <commit-hash> | grep -i "key\|secret\|password\|token"

# Check if others have pulled the compromised commits
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

#### **Step 3: Document the Incident**
- **Time of discovery:** [Current timestamp]
- **Commits affected:** [List commit hashes]
- **Credentials exposed:** [List types - API keys, DB passwords, etc.]
- **Repository visibility:** Public
- **Estimated exposure time:** [Time since commit was pushed]

## üîß **GIT REMEDIATION (After Credential Rotation)**

### **Option A: Safe Approach (Recommended for Team Repositories)**

```bash
# 1. Create a revert commit to remove secrets
git log --oneline -5  # Find the problematic commit hash

# 2. Revert the commit that added secrets
git revert <commit-hash-with-secrets>

# 3. Add .gitignore to prevent future accidents
echo "*.key" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pem" >> .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
echo "config.ini" >> .gitignore
echo "secrets.txt" >> .gitignore

# 4. Commit the .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "security: add .gitignore to prevent credential commits"

# 5. Push the fix
git push origin main
```

### **Option B: History Rewrite (Only if no one else has pulled)**

```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Only use if you're certain no one has pulled the commits

# 1. Interactive rebase to remove the problematic commit
git rebase -i HEAD~5  # Go back 5 commits (adjust as needed)

# 2. In the editor, change 'pick' to 'drop' for the commit with secrets
# Save and exit

# 3. Force push (dangerous - use with extreme caution)
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### **Option C: Nuclear Option (Complete Repository Reset)**

```bash
# Only if exposure is severe and repository is personal
# 1. Create new repository
# 2. Copy clean code (without secrets)
# 3. Update all references to new repository
# 4. Delete old repository (after ensuring no data loss)
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **PREVENTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Pre-commit Hooks Setup**

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks to catch secrets
pip install pre-commit detect-secrets

# Create .pre-commit-config.yaml
cat > .pre-commit-config.yaml << EOF
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    rev: v1.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
        args: ['--baseline', '.secrets.baseline']
EOF

# Install the hooks
pre-commit install

# Create initial baseline
detect-secrets scan . > .secrets.baseline
```

### **2. Environment Variable Configuration**

```bash
# Create .env.example template
cat > .env.example << EOF
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname  # pragma: allowlist secret

# API Keys
API_SECRET=your-api-secret-here  # pragma: allowlist secret
THIRD_PARTY_API_KEY=your-third-party-key-here  # pragma: allowlist secret

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key-here
EOF

# Update application to use environment variables
# Example Python code:
```

```python
# Replace hardcoded secrets with environment variables
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Instead of:
# API_SECRET = "sk-live-1234567890abcdef"
# Use:
API_SECRET = os.environ.get('API_SECRET')
if not API_SECRET:
    raise ValueError("API_SECRET environment variable is required")
```

### **3. Enhanced .gitignore**

```bash
# Add comprehensive .gitignore
cat >> .gitignore << EOF
# Secrets and credentials
.env
.env.local
.env.production
*.key
*.pem
*.p12
*.pfx
secrets.txt
config.ini
credentials.json

# IDE and OS files
.vscode/
.idea/
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Application specific
*.log
*.db
*.sqlite
temp/
cache/
EOF
```

## üìã **TEAM COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL**

### **Immediate Notifications**

#### **Security Team Alert Template**
```
üö® SECURITY INCIDENT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Incident: API credentials exposed in public repository
Time: [Timestamp]
Severity: HIGH
Repository: [Repository URL]

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN:
‚úÖ Credentials rotated
‚úÖ Production systems updated
‚úÖ Git history being cleaned

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
- Security team: Verify no unauthorized API usage
- DevOps: Monitor production systems

## üîç **POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS**

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Contributing Factors**
1. **Human Error:** Developer unfamiliar with secure coding practices
2. **Process Gap:** No pre-commit hooks to catch secrets
3. **Training Gap:** Insufficient security awareness training
4. **Tool Gap:** No automated secret scanning in CI/CD

#### **Timeline of Events**
```
T-0: Developer commits code with hardcoded API key
T+5min: Code pushed to public repository
T+2hrs: Incident discovered during code review
T+2hrs 5min: Credentials rotated (immediate response)
T+2hrs 15min: Git history cleaned
T+2hrs 30min: Prevention measures implemented
T+1day: Security audit completed
```

### **Lessons Learned**

#### **What Went Well**
- ‚úÖ Rapid incident detection (2 hours)
- ‚úÖ Immediate credential rotation
- ‚úÖ Effective team communication
- ‚úÖ No evidence of credential abuse

#### **What Could Be Improved**
- ‚ùå Prevention: No pre-commit hooks in place
- ‚ùå Detection: Should have been caught earlier
- ‚ùå Training: Developer unaware of risks
- ‚ùå Process: No security checklist for commits
